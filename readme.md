### Description
This repository contains the advanced version of the original
physical properties tool for Garry's mod. It is designed to
have fully customizable surface properties configuration lists,
that you can modify, create, update and structure by yourself.
The tool can support many more surface properties than its original
brother, though the configuration you have to make yourself.

### Donations
I am supporting this tool in my free time mostly and it was quite a
ride since I already first created it. But since my lack of time for
playing gmod has been drastically increased some people asked me if
I accept donations, here is the [link to my PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/DeyanVasilev).

### Configuration
Looking for that, you better see the [Wiki](https://github.com/dvdvideo1234/PhysPropertiesAdv/wiki/Adding-configurations)

### How to install the extension
Just clone [this repo](https://github.com/dvdvideo1234/PhysPropertiesAdv) in your addons folder,
then copy [the configuration files](https://github.com/dvdvideo1234/PhysPropertiesAdv/tree/master/data/physprop_adv/materials) inside  
your `DATA` folder `garrysmod/data/physprop_adv/materials/*.txt`

### Are you gonna release it on the [workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/4000/workshop) ?
So far I do not have such intensions as the workshop does not support 
external configuration text files with the database inside. I also cannot
ship comma separated values [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) or [TSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) as a local database standard as the workshop will
reject them immediately as a `harmful data`. Take the [`Track Assembly Tool`](https://github.com/dvdvideo1234/TrackAssemblyTool)
for example which has integrated the database in the initialization file. Its idea is
different than this tool by creating a full solution where the user may not interact
by changing the integrated database.
