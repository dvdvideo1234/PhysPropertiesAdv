Description

This repository contains the advanced version of the original
physical properties tool for Garry's mod. It is designed to
have fully customizable surface properties configuration lists,
that you can modify, create, update and structure by yourself.
The tool can support many more surface properties than its original
brother, though the configuration you have to make yourself.
